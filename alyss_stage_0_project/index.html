	<h1>Important Concepts</h1>
	<h3>The basics of the WEB</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>The WEB</li>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>URL's</li>
		<li>HTTP</li>
		<li>Web Applications</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>How the Web works</h3>
	The web is a collection of computers which communicate each other via network protocols.<br>
	When you are typing on your web Browser the url of a web site for example www.udacity.com, your computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a Server.<br>
	The Server finds the requested web document and sends it back to your computer. You can see now the web page on your web Browser.
	<h3>WWW</h3>
	WWW is an acronym for <em>world wide web</em> and is a collection of HTML documents.<br>
	HTML documents are made of HTML.<br>
	<h3>HTML</h3>
	HTML is a <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> and is the basis of every web page.<br>
	Links between the pages are called <em>Hyper Links</em>.
	<h3>WEB as a collection of HTML-documents</h3>
	You can imagine the WEB as a collection of HTML-documents which are linked to each other.<br><br>

	<h3>HTML contents</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The text content describes actually what you see.</li>
		<li>The markup describes how it looks like.</li>
		<li>The references to other document types like images, music, videos.</li>
		<li>The links to other pages such as the following examples:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwhvByj8YG8" target="_blank">music theme from hawaii FIVE 0</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://a3ab771892fd198a96736e50.javacodegeeks.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Must-read-articles-for-Programmers-and-Software-Developers.jpg" target="_blank">image link</a></li>

			</ul>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>The major pieces of internet</h3>
	All in one the pieces of internet make the big picture of how it looks like.<br><br>
	<img src="images/my_figure_1.jpg" alt="major pieces">
	
	<h3>HTML markup</h3>
	An HTML markup is made of tags. A tag has the following structure.<br>
	<img src="images/element.jpg" alt="tag"><br>
	<p>Here are some examples for bold and italics tags.</p>
	I am going to learn to <b>love HTML</b><br>
	I am going to learn to <em>love HTML</em><br>
	I am going to learn to <em><b>love HTML</b></em><br>
	
	<h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
	An HTML attribute gives an HTML element a property.
	<ul>
		<li>HTML elements can have attributes.</li>
		<li>Attributes provide additional information about an element.</li>
		<li>Attributes are always specified in the start tag.</li>
		<li>Attributes come in name/value pairs like: name="value".</li>
	</ul>
	The href attribute has the following syntax.<br><br>
	<img src="images/link.jpg" alt="link"><br>
	And here is the link of it.<br>
	<a href="http://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">udacity</a>
	
	<h3>Another example of an Image Element</h3>
	The img attribute has the following syntax.<br><br>
	<img src="images/img.jpg" alt="image"><br>
	Below is an image of a new programmer.<br><br>
	<img src="http://a3ab771892fd198a96736e50.javacodegeeks.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Must-read-articles-for-Programmers-and-Software-Developers.jpg" alt="programmer" height="20%", width="20%"><br><br>
	
	<h3>Whitespace</h3>
	You can add a new line or a paragraph, when you are writing HTML-documents, in order to make them more readable. There are some examples here.<br> 
	Hello everyone! <br>We're using two lines now!
	<p>Hello everyone!</p> 
	<p>We're using two paragraphs now!</p>
	HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.<br>
	The syntax and the differences between a line and a paragraph are given by the following image.<br><br>
	<img src="images/paragraph.jpg" alt="inline-block">
	
	<h3>The HTML Span and Div Element</h3>
	The HTML div element is a block level element that can be used as a container for other HTML elements.<br>
	The HTML span element is an inline element that can be used as a container for text.<br>
	<span>We're using span now!</span>
	<div>We are using div now!</div>. <br>
	<img src="images/spn_div.jpg" alt="span-div">
	
	<h3>HTML Basic structure</h3>
	The basic structure of an HTML document looks like as following:<br>

	<h3>Synopsis</h3>
	In this very first introductory project we got an idea about the following terms.<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>What a Web Page is</b></li>
			A hypertext document connected to the World Wide Web.
		<li><b>How Coding Works</b></li>
			The short answer is that writing code tells the computer what to do, but it is not quite that simple.
		<li><b>Computers are stupid</b></li>
			Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.<br> 
		<li><b>Programmers can't remember everything.</b></li>
			Programming requires projects and specific problems to solve to stick in your brain.
		<li><b>Basic HTML vocabulary</b></li>
			It is about the syntax and the semantic of tags, attributes and other elements.
